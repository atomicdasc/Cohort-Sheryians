          This is the first paragraph of my blog post. I'm excited to share my
          thoughts and experiences with you all. In this post, I will be talking
          about my day. <br />
          <br />
          Let's start with my morning. I woke up early and had a cup of coffee.
          Then, I decided to go for a walk in the park. It was a beautiful sunny
          day, and the birds were singing. I saw many people walking their dogs
          and children playing. It was very refreshing.

          Here is an image related to my walk in the park (imagine it's a
          picture of a park!).
        </p>
        <h3>Things I saw in the park (List Example):</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Beautiful flowers</li>
          <li>Squirrels running around</li>
          <li>People doing yoga</li>
          <li>A small pond with ducks</li>
